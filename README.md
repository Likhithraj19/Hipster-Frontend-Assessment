# ThemeSwitcher

Welcome to ThemeSwitcher, a modern React application designed to showcase a dynamic and highly customizable theming system. This project demonstrates how to build a flexible UI that can be transformed in real-time, affecting everything from colors and fonts to layouts and animations.

- **🎬 Configurable Animations**: Choose from various animation styles (e.g., bounce, slide, scale) and settings (duration, easing) to see how they impact user interactions.
- **⚛️ Modern Tech Stack**: Built with the latest technologies including React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
